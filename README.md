## Data-Driven Optimization for Ajker Deal E-Commerce Growth

## Project Overview:

### Company: Ajker Deal
### Industry: E-commerce (Fashion & Apparel)

## Project Focus:

The goal of this project was to enhance Ajker Deal website conversion rate by analyzing customer behavior, identifying drop-off points, 
and implementing data-driven solutions to improve the user experience and boost sales.

## Tools & Technologies Used:

    1. Google Analytics 4 (GA4): For tracking user behavior, events, and conversions across the website and app.
    
    2. BigQuery: For advanced data analysis and querying large datasets from GA4.
    
    3. Looker Studio: For creating visual reports and real-time dashboards to track KPIs.
    
    4. Microsoft Clarity: For heatmaps and session recordings to understand user behavior and friction points.

    5. Python: 


## Project Phases & Approach:

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Setup (Integrate GA4 & BigQuery):

    1. Configured Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to export data to BigQuery, enabling more detailed and granular analysis.
    
    2. Set up automated queries to track product views, add-to-cart events, revenue, and user demographics to gather insights across different user segments.

    
### Phase 2: Data Analysis & Insights:

  #### Overall Performance Metrcis:
    
    1. Cart Abandonment Rate: 90.28%
    
    2. Checkout Abandonment Rate: 85.31%
    
    3. Conversion Rate: 2.11%
    
    4. Average Order Value (AOV): $63.63

  #### Key Findings:

    1. High abandonment rates at both cart and checkout stages pointed to potential friction in the purchase journey.
    
    2. The low conversion rate suggested a need for significant optimization in the user journey and checkout flow.
    
    3. AOV analysis highlighted opportunities for increasing sales through cross-selling and upselling.
